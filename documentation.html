		<h1>Daedalus - Documentation</h1>

		<h2>Play Area</h2>
		<p>
			The play area consists of a square table: 11 rows, with 11 cells.
			Accounting for walls, this results in a 9x9 space to explore in each room.
			The appearance of each cell is set by css, and controlled with data
			attributes. Items within a cell are considered "actors" and can
			include the player, a monster, or loot items on the floor.
			If an "actor" is provided, it will be rendered using an <b>:after</b>
			pseudo element, derived from data attributes. Rooms are randomly
			generated, with 2-4 exits to other rooms.
		</p>

		<h2>Menu</h2>
		<p>
			Menus are implemented as elements in a persistent containing element.
			The menu-container is positioned above the play area using z-index
			and absolute positioning. This has the effect of ensuring the menu
			is visible, and the play area can't be interacted with while the
			menu is open. Buttons are created by adding literal <tag>button</tag>
			or <tag>a</tag> tags to the <tag>menu</tag> element.
		</p>

		<h2>Data</h2>
		<p>
			Game data is kept in a model space, that can be saved, exported,
			and generated separately from the user interfaces and play area.
			The data model holds two structures, an instance of the world map
			and an instance of the player class. The map class holds data to
			represent all of the cell data for a room, including tile types,
			actors, and neighor rooms. The game class also contains	pointers
			to libraries of possible creatures and items, ajax loaded from an
			external source.
		</p>

		<h2>Audio</h2>
		<p>
			Audio in the game is handled by an audio controller class, capable
			of adding and manipulating <tag>audio</tag> tags. Created tags
			are not appended to the document, and can only be manipulated through
			the element pointers saved in the controller.
		</p>

		<h2>Game Logic</h2>
		<p>
			Game logic currently consists entirely of a completed set of menu
			interactions, an event stack, a game tick loop, and a series of
			computations in the creature class that automatically poll current
			magical effects, abilities, and equipped items to determine derived
			stats and values using D&amp;D style formulas.
			Logic that still needs to be implemented consists of player navigation,
			player interaction with other actors, and navigation to other rooms.
			Rudimentary player movement existed in an older version of the app,
			but has not yet been re-implemented in the current re-based version.
			Logic exists for sending and handling events between app components.
