		<h3>Description</h3><hr/>
		<p>
			In the context of this project, Daedalus is the title of a minimal roguelike rpg
			that takes place in an infinite labyrinth. It is a project for my college web-design
			class, and while it is far from my first web app, it is my first attempt at a video game.
		</p>
		<p>
			Daedalus is played using only the mouse, to direct your character around a 5x5 grid of tiles.
			This 5x5 grid represents one room of infinitely many, and each tile represents a floor, wall,
			or door. Additionally, any floor tiles also hold data about what, if anything, is occupying
			that space: you, a monster, an item, etc. Each room contains 2-4 doors, that lead to other rooms.
